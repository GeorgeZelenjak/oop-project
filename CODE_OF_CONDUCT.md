# Code of conduct

*Commitment and Ambition come first, and "I will do it"*

## Our values
- Pleasant atmosphere in the team.
- Ability to have some family/free time.
- Freedom of choosing your own approach as long as it doesn’t interfere with others.
- The result and process are more important than the grade.
- Challenging ourselves to achieve greater results and learn more

## Behaviour
- Team members should be able to trust each other and be open and honest in their
communication.
- Team members must equally participate in the project.
- Team members should give each other credit for their work and encourage each other.
- Team members should help each other and ask for help when they need it.
- Team members must respect each other’s personal preferences and individualities.
- Team members should have a precise personal, team schedule and use time efficiently.
- Team members must inform others beforehand if they are not able to attend a meeting.
- A decision affecting the group must be made on the basis of consensus.
- In case of disagreements or conflicts, the whole group must work together to find
common ground and solve the problem. If all else fails, get in touch with the group TA.
- If a team member does not work sufficiently or regularly fails to do his tasks, this must
be addressed in the group. If this does not help, this must be forwarded to the TA.

## Coding guidelines
- Written code must have comments when needed and JavaDoc included for all methods.
Readable and easily understandable code styling must be used. Variables and methods
names must be meaningful.
- Operations on the Git repository must never be forced.
- When in doubt, consult documentation/TA/team members in order not to cause harm.
- The master branch is only for the stable/working/verified version of the project. Work on
your own branch and when you think you are ready, make a merge request for master
branch. Discuss this with your team members first and after everyone’s approval do the
merge.
- You must be able to understand the code you are writing and be able to explain it to
other team members.


*This is a living document that will evolve together with the group. Any new rules/guidelines
that are agreed upon in the group will be added here.*
