## Code of conduct

# Commitment and Ambition come first

## Our values
- Team members should try to maintain a pleasant atmosphere.
- Everyone should be able to have some family/free time.
- Everyone should have freedom of choosing their own approach as long as this doesn’t limit other team members’ freedom and does not impede the project.
- The result and process are more important than the grade.
- Challenging ourselves is important to achieve greater results and learn more.
- A decision affecting the group should be made on the basis of consensus.
- Have fun!

## Behaviour
- Team members must trust each other and be open and honest in their communication.
- Everyone must equally participate in the project.
- Give credit when deserved and encourage your team members.
- Help your team members when they need help.
- Respect each other’s personal preferences and individualities.
- Have a precise personal and team schedule and try to manage your time efficiently.
- Inform other team members beforehand if you are not able to attend a meeting.
- In case of disagreements or conflicts, the whole group must work together to find common ground and solve the problem.

## Coding guidelines
- Written code must have comments when needed and JavaDoc included for all methods. Readable and easy understandable code styling must be used. Variables and methods names must be meaningful.
- Never force operations on the Git repository.
- When in doubt, better consult documentation/TA/team members in order not to do more harm.
- Work on your own branch and make a merge request for master branch when you think it’s ready (discuss this with your team members first and after everyone’s approval do the merge). The master branch is only for the stable/working/verified version of the project.
- You have to be able to understand the code you are writing and be able to explain it to other team members.
